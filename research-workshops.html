    <h1>Research Workshops</h1>
    <section>
    <p>Research workshops empower your students to find, evaluate, use, and communicate information. Our goal is to equip students with the information literacy skills necessary to critically analyze knowledge across moral, economic, and political contexts.</p><br>
    <p>Workshops, team-taught with you, can be held in your classroom, the library, or online. We also offer curriculum development support to help you identify special sources or integrate information literacy skills into your assignments.</p><br>
    <p>To learn more or schedule a workshop, please contact your <a href="https://library.qc.cuny.edu/services/research/specialists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subject librarian</a> for personalized support or complete the form below.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Schedule the session about 2 to 3 weeks before your research assignment is due.</li>
            <li>Ensure that students are familiar with their research assignment before the session.</li>
            <li>Attend the session with your students in order to provide important disciplinary context and to support their learning.</li>
